Read this file, if you do not understand how to install this LUA script.
Before we install the project, make sure your GTA has the following modifications installed: 

ASI Loader: https://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=21709
Moonloader: https://gtaforums.com/topic/890987-moonloader/
CLEO: https://cleo.li/


If you possess all those mods in your GTA, proceed with the following steps:

Note: If you do not possess any external lua script to reload your folder, while ingame,
then close your game for the whole process!

1) Put bass.dll, lua51.dll and Moonloader.asi into your root gta folder!

2) Place all of the Folder "Sensfix"'s Content into your local moonloader folder.
    
3) Use your external reloader or restart your game.

4) While ingame, use the command "/sens" to open the menu!
